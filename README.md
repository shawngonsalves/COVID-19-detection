# COVID-19-detection

# Problem
COVID-19 is spreading at an unprecedented rate all around the globe. Health care systems are experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure and health professionals work on exhausting shifts to deal with the demand. As patients flood clinics and hospitals for a checkup to see if they have the virus, it becomes a burden for the doctors to check all the incoming patients since It’s impossible to know without a test. While carrying out the test using CT scan images, a drawback is that the analysis requires an expert and takes significant time — which is precious when people are sick around the world.

# Deep Learning Technique used
As we would be classifying the CT scans of the lungs, we would be using VGG16 (VGG16 is Convolution Neural Networks used to train large datasets of images). Convolution is a technique that allows us to extract visual features from an image in small chunks. Each neuron in a convolution layer is responsible for a small cluster of neurons in the preceding layer. 

# System
We propose to develop a deep learning model that takes CT scan images of patients as input and predicts if the person suffers from the virus based on the CT scan of the persons’ lungs. This would significantly reduce the time taken in analyzing the CT scan images and thereby increasing the efficiency of detecting the virus
